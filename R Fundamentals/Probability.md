# Probability:
Discrete Probability:
* Categorical data uses discrete probability.
* Probability of an event = Proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment over and over, independently and under the same cirumstances:

Pr(A) = Probability of event A
* Event is defined as an outcome that can happen by chance. 
* sample(vector, num_of_items_to_pick) can be used to randomly pick item(s), based on the value of num_of_items_to_pick, from the vector.

  Monte Carlo Simulations:
  * Monte Carlo simulation is when you repeat an experiment so many times the outcomes are similar to if it was being repeated       infinitely. You can change the random seed of sample() using set_seed() and make sure to set it to a number before doing Monte Carlo. Also, Monte Carlo simulations can be really accurate if the repetitions are sufficent.
  * replicate(num_of_times_to_be_repeated, function_to_be_repeated) can emulate a Monte Carlo simulation. Set num_of_times_to_be_repeated to a very high number (10,000). Also, function_to_be_repeated is usually sample().
  * To find which number makes a Monte Carlo simulation stable (number that makes the probability accurate) you can keep on making the number of repitions larger and larger and graph this until there are no more wide flucuations:

* Probability distribution is the proportion for each group.
* Conditional probabilites are useful when events are non-independent (dependent) using the multiplicative rule:

Pr(A and B) = Pr(A) * Pr(B | A) 

Note: The pipe operator (|) stands for given that or conditional or. This can also be expanded to hold more variables:

Pr(A and B and C) = Pr(A) * Pr(B | A) * Pr(C | A and B)

The multiplicative rule for independent events is:

Pr(A and B) = Pr(A) * Pr(B) 

OR

Pr(A and B and C) = Pr(A) * Pr(B) * Pr(C)
* The function, expand.grid(), gives all the combinations for 2 vectors.
```r
expand.grid(pants = c("blue", "black"), shirts = c("white", "grey", "plaid"))
```
* permutations(n, r, dataset) from the gtools package lists the different ways that r items can be selected from a set of n options when order matters.
* combinations(n, r, datset) from the gtools package lists the different ways that r items can be selected from a set of n options when order does not matter.
```r
sapply(vector, operation) # sapply allows element-wise operations on vectors.
```
* duplicated() and any() are important functions for probability. duplicated() checks for duplications and any() checks if any value is equal to a certain one:
```r
set.seed(1)
celtic_wins <- replicate(10000, {
  simulated_games <- sample(c("lose","win"), 4, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.6, 0.4))
  simulated_games
  any(simulated_games == "win")
})
```
Addition rule - The addition rule is the probability of A or B:
Pr(A or B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) âˆ’ Pr(A and B)
