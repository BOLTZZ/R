# What does this repository cover?
This repository covers most of the basics of R and includes projects created by me. Though, this repository doesn't cover everything in R, to learn much more about R you should check out the following resources:
* [Datacamp R](https://www.statmethods.net/index.html)
* Profesor Rafalab's [book](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/) on R and Data Science (some really in depth stuff)!
* [Codeacademy R](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r)
